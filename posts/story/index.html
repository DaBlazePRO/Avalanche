            <h2 id="the-gone-land">The Gone Land</h2>
<p>Long ago, before the revolution everything thrived, now I may be the last human left on earth. I have been living by myself for five years since my parents died in the year 4098. I was born here in the bunker and never have seen the outside world. My parents told me stories of the old days where everything was alive, now you die the moment you step out. I have been told there may not be any survivors, I refuse to accept that. Today I will step out, with the proper precaution, of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to die! “My name is Tobias and I am 16 years old. Today I step foot into the real world.” I opened the first door which took a little nudge to open. My father told me the hazmat suits would be there if I ever had to go outside. After opening 2 more doors I finally reached the last one, my heart rate spiked as I pulled the last one wide open.
Everything was gray, I don’t know why I expected so much. Nevertheless, I embarked on my journey to find life. I walked towards the big light out in the distance hoping for civilization. As I walked I saw a black gooey substance flowing through canals. It was very hard to see because of the black smoke everywhere which my mother had told me about. She had also told me about how clear water used to flow through these canals. As I ventured out a bit more I looked at a sign which said Michigan. In the distance I saw something moving so I quickly ran towards it. As I neared I could see a man without a mask, I couldn’t believe it, I wasn’t alone in this toxic wasteland.
I called out, “HEY, please come back, I need to talk to you.” When he finally stopped I saw his face. The stranger had hard scaly skin and had no hair. “Hi, my name is Tobias, until a few minutes ago I thought I was the last person alive, I am very excited to see someone.” I could see the man was studying me, he stared at my blonde hair and smooth face. He didn’t talk for a while but suddenly said, “My name is Charles… you must know, there are more.”
“WHAT, there are more, I beg you to show me I am tired of living by myself.”
“You can’t, we are the last colony standing but you have to go back, the other colonies have fallen. The emperor is capturing people to make slaves out of them.”
I started crying but he couldn’t see it, “Please… I can help you, I can’t stay by myself. You don’t know how it felt, I was born in the bunker, raised without seeing anything and now I’m being told to go back! I&rsquo;m tired of waiting for the world to fix itself.” He paused and thought about what he was about to say, “Look, the emperor, he is a very ruthless man, he has enslaved thousands and killed millions. Many brave souls have sought to end the tyranny but have failed, I have to know that you can do this.”
“I promise on the earth, I will make a change… if I get hurt I will get back up, if I die I’ll brush it off and try harder, whatever it takes!”
“Great! We have no time to waste, we must move quickly and reach the others before it’s dark.”
I wondered how it could get darker in the smoke-covered air. Nonetheless, I followed this person in hopes of making a change, helping future generations, and giving them a chance no one has right now. During the journey I realized what the world had come to, everything that lived once was now null. I looked up in hopes of seeing this thing called a cloud which my mom had told me about but I was left disappointed. As we walked through the barren wasteland I noticed bones scattered through the ground. I felt great sorrow for everything that had passed away. After what seemed like an eternity we came to a stop, “We are here,” Charlie said sternly. Now I was befuddled, there was nothing there. I started to think this was a bad idea and Charlie was going cuckoo. “Uhm, there is nothing here Charlie.”
“Of course why would there, we wouldn’t want to get captured. The earth may have declined but the technology of humans has advanced greatly. Behold, the rebellion.”
I was amazed, my brain could not comprehend what I was seeing, hundreds of people just appeared before my eyes. Charlie introduced me to everyone but was interrupted by a young fellow, “Charlie, we must attack now, we have searched everywhere there is no one left. This is our only chance before the emperor becomes too powerful.” He agreed and so did I even though I didn’t know what we were going against. Charlie and the others quickly started revising their plan to fit their time, “We must assault the soldiers, our rebellion must go in before they are allowed to warn anyone,” Charlie explained. We would cause a commotion outside of their highly protected dome, then Charlie and a few others including me would sneak in and defeat the emperor. The plan sounded so perfect but everyone knew a plethora of things could go wrong. Charlie turned to me, I didn’t like how he looked at me but it gave me courage, “Look, Tobias, I need you to take that suit off. With it, you would only be slowing the team. I promise you will be unaffected by the air. If you want you can put on this mask to make you feel better.” I believed him and took it off, I could feel the heavy air around me, the air was a lot thicker than the air I had at the bunker. Even with the mask my head felt a bit dizzy and plop, I fell to the ground.
I don’t know how long I was out but as I started to wake up, I could tell I was being moved. As I got up I saw the monstrosity of a dome in front of me. Before we started the plan I asked Charlie something that has been sitting in the back of my mind since we met, “Charlie, how is it that everyone has scaly skin and no hair. I am going to guess it&rsquo;s because of the air but why isn’t it affecting me?”
“You see, we were born after the Earth got messed up. Our parents were fine but when they took in the toxic air it made their children have the effects of the chemicals.”
“That’s horrible, I am very sorry for you.”
“It’s nothing to be sad about, what we must do now is defeat the emperor and end his tyranny.”
“I never got to ask, what did the emperor do? I get he is enslaving people but shouldn&rsquo;t we be more worried about the environment?”
“Well, before all of this there was a king of this land called the president. He is the reason this happened, he was warned about what would happen if the world lived the way it did but he was money hungry. Even his dome is emitting toxic chemicals into the air.”
With that I knew everything that I needed to know, I was going to defeat the emperor and bring peace to this intoxicated world.
After we arrived outside the dome we detonated some explosives off in the distance. With that, the guards rushed to the site leaving the entrance wide open. We hurried inside where everything was different. The water was clear, there were clouds, trees, and fresh air. I went to go feel the tree but it was cold and smooth. My mother had described them to have a texture, I didn’t think this was a real tree.  When I looked outside the dome it showed a beautiful world, not the one I just came from. That dome showed me how the world was before the toxication, it was beautiful and it was a world I wanted to live in. A few members stayed back while the rest of us went up to the castle. As Charlie led us through the hallways I wondered how he knew where to go. It was almost as if he had been here before, he might have been here to study it so I didn’t give it a second thought. Before long we reached a door labeled Emperors Den.
We all took deep breaths and opened the door. To our demise, guards were waiting for us, quickly guards came behind us as well. A figure came through the guards, it was the emperor. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Charlie took his side. “I am sorry, NOT REALLY, but on a reconnaissance mission here, I was captured and was given a deal. I could live here if I handed everyone in. At that moment I saw who I was, I didn’t want to fix the world, all I wanted was to live out my life.”
“HOW COULD YOU, I TRUSTED YOU, I WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND YOU BETRAYED ALL OF US.”
Tears flooded my face as we were dragged into prison. With all the rage that built up, I slipped out of all the guards and punched Charlie in the face. I was quickly taken by the guards and I could see his grin across his sore face, knowing that I would be locked up forever.
At that moment I regretted everything. I should have never gotten the thought of coming outside, I should have not run to Charlie, I should have gone back when I had the chance. I pushed myself into a corner of the prison holding thousands of captured humans. I felt miserable, for the next few days I didn’t move at all, staying still and not listening to the guards. Everyone knew my name, I was called the kid with a broken heart. They all knew to leave me alone and they did.
I was starting to feel hopeless when a girl that wasn’t like the others and had hair came up to me, “Hey get up, this is no place to die. I know you may feel that everything is lost but I promise, there is still hope. Follow me, I want to show you something.” I followed her into an uninhabited part of the prison. From the back, she pulled out a flower, a living plant right before my eyes. Next, she pulled out seeds for various vegetables and plants. A wave of hope and confidence came over me, now that I saw something was worth fighting for. My pain of the betrayal had gone away. “These are the last seeds left on earth, I need you to help me cultivate them,” the girl told me.
“Thank you, you don’t know how much this means to me. Knowing that there is something left to fight for has given me the courage to keep fighting.”
“I have a plan ready to break out, you just need to come with me. When I saw you, it reminded me of myself, regretful and angry at everything. Someone else had changed me and I felt it was my civil duty to help you.”
The girl whom I had known nothing of was now telling me about her plan to escape. We planned to use the ventilation system to traverse the castle. Once all the guards fell asleep we silently got into a duct and started the plan. Halfway through I looked down and I couldn’t believe what I saw, it was Charlie. I started fuming and I could tell she saw that,
“It isn’t worth it, trust me I tried.”
“You don’t understand, he betrayed me, and everyone else. I don’t even know you who are, for all I know you could betray me like Charlie.”
“My name is Quesha and I was once like you. I tried to get revenge on those who hurt me and I succeeded. It changed nothing, I still felt the same way. When I saw there was hope left for this planet it changed me, please resist.”
I started to calm down, I was still aggravated by what Charlie had done but I kept my cool because I knew defeating the king was more important. As we continued through the air duct Quesha told me about a team she belonged to, it consisted of people who were betrayed, and trust was misused. Once we made it outside we were greeted by her team, they took me in as one of their own and it felt like a family. They explained to me how they rescued prisoners which I thought was very clever. A few people would disguise themselves as prisoners to find more people to join their team which I thought was very clever. I  joined their team and rescued countless others in prisons situated across the world. With the help of rescued prisoners, we defeated the emperor and started efforts to fix the world.
Epilogue
Generations after the efforts of Quesha and Tobias the world changed, everything thrived as it once did. “See children, this is how your great, great, great, great, great grandfather and grandmother changed the world, to give you and me a better future,” said Tobey one of Tobias’s descendants. After Tobias defeated the emperor, he and Quesha fell in love while rejuvenating the world. Their efforts inspired many more to make a change, within 120 years Earth was able to prosper again. “Dad, whatever happened to Charlie? I hope something really bad happened to him, he deserves it for what he did,” said Tobey’s son.
“Well, it turned out Charlie wasn’t that bad after all. He was a misguided fellow and your grandpa helped him.”
“WHAT, how? How is something able to change from bad to good.”
“This is a very important lesson son. One thing doesn’t define you, that is what your grandmother Quesha taught Tobias. Instead of fighting Charlie, he reasoned with him. Somewhere the light shined and Charlie helped clean the Earth!”
“Why didn’t he reason with the emperor?”
“He tried but failed, and he couldn’t let you, your mother, myself, or anyone to have a bad future so he did what had to be done.”
With that, the family looked outside and admired the blue skies with clouds, the natural green trees waving in the wind, and the statue that was built in recognition of Tobias’s and Quesha’s efforts.</p>
